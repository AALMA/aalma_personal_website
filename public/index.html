		Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my site. If you don't know who I am already I am Adam Alma. I am a techology enthusaist who has been lucky enough to make a career doing things I love. Two things I love doing are software development and mentoring / leading teams to unlock their full potential. Below you will find a few links to some more specific things I'd like to share. The main purpose of this site today is to share my resume in a format where I can expand more on my experiences and showcase how they can be helpful to potential partners that may be interested.
